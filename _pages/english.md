# 👤 Bio

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Professor Xiangyang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/) (ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow). My research interests focus on optimization in complex networks, including optimization of deep learning model inference ((primary research focus)), intelligent sensing in the Internet of Things, and security of intelligent models. Feel free to contact me via email.

# 📝 Research

### Model Inference Optimization

Model inference optimization (primary research focus): This area addresses performance bottlenecks when deep learning models are deployed in real-world applications. The goal is to enhance the inference efficiency of deep learning models, reduce computational costs, minimize latency, and optimize resource utilization while maintaining or improving accuracy, ultimately achieving cost reduction and efficiency enhancement.
- **Application Project:** Independently responsible for research on multimodal large model computational optimization in the **NIO Industry-University Collaboration Project** "Intelligent Cockpit Inference Optimization Based on Large Models", aiming to reduce computational load, decrease inference latency, and minimize KV Cache memory usage.
- **Application Project:** Independently responsible for research on distributed inference optimization for large models under heterogeneous computing power in the **Huawei Industry-University Collaboration Project** "AI Efficiency Improvement on the Edge", aiming to enhance inference throughput and improve resource utilization under heterogeneous computing environments.
- **Application Project:** Participated in the development of an industry knowledge base and large model Q&A system in the **Baidu Industry-University Collaboration Project** "ESG Domain-Specific Question Answering System", focusing on real system optimization for vertical domain knowledge Q&A.
- **First Author Paper:** **[CCF A]** A-VL: Adaptive Attention for Large Vision-Language Models.
- **Co-first Author Paper:** **[CCF A]** TensAllo: Adaptive Deployment of LLMs on Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous Edge Devices.
- **Collaborative Paper:** PICE: A Semantic-Driven Progressive Inference System for LLM Serving in Cloud-Edge Networks.
- **Collaborative Paper:** **[CCF A]** 面向智能物联网的资源高效模型推理综述。

### Intelligent Sensing

Intelligent sensing: The deep integration of artificial intelligence and information sensing technology, leveraging wireless signals for environmental perception, object detection, and behavior recognition. This technology overcomes the limitations of traditional sensors, such as light and visibility angle, and offers advantages in low power consumption, non-contact sensing, and high precision. Intelligent sensing often leads to unexpected breakthroughs using common wireless signals, combining inspiration and creativity to drive innovation.
- **First Author Paper: [CCF A]** WordWhisper: Exploiting Real-Time, Hardware-Dependent IoT Communication Against Eavesdropping.
 
### Model Security

Model inference security: Model inference security can be divided into three stages: pre-inference (input security), during inference (weight security), and post-inference (output security). From a goal-oriented perspective, it can further be categorized into end-to-end data protection (privacy) during the computation process and authentication and traceability (public) after computation. My collaborators and I primarily focus on authentication and traceability of intelligent model computations post-inference, aiming to protect the legitimate interests of all parties involved.

# 🌏 Service

- Teaching Assistant: Served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level course "Computer Applied Mathematics" at USTC in 2023.
- Volunteer Activities: Volunteered for the ACM TURC, as well as for various events such as the college’s evening parties, among others.


# 💫 Hobbies

Beyond my research work, I also have a passion for **photography** (Nikon fan), music (singing and guitar), and gaming (PC & Switch)—feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about any of these! I'm also fond of hosting and have had the pleasure of hosting two university-level events, one at the college level, and two in the lab. It's always a joy to meet new people!
I love experimenting with various quirky coding projects—coding things I enjoy is a true pleasure, and the sense of accomplishment constantly drives me to explore what comes next.
Work hard, but also enjoy life. ✨
